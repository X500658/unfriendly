As of writing this, I (X500658) am currently studying for the JLPT <strike>N4</strike> N3 exam which I'll be taking this December <strike>2023</strike> 2024. This site's main intention is to be an easily accessible resource containing everything in my learning materials. I don't want to read through the books I'm using when I'm just looking for one tiny thing, and I think my peers do too.

N5 and N4 use Minna no Nihongo.
N3 uses Try!

## Why does this exist?
This is just going to containg the basic stuff, grammar structure and special use cases and reading. *This is not meant to be used as a learning resource.* I will be making this in such a way that it is just meant to be used as a quick resource/review, just a quick peek.

Yeah, I just pretty much copied this from the [Welcome post]({% post_url 2023-09-03-welcome %})

## Thanks
Special thanks to my senseis, [Techno Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnoTim) and [Jadehawk's Tech Notes](https://www.youtube.com/@jadehawk) for the Jekyll tutorials
