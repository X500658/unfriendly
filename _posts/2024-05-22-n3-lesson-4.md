## Sentence Pattern 31 - Contraction form 縮約形
| Normal Form | Contraction Form |
| ている | てる |
| ておく | とく |
| てしまう・でしまう | ちゃ・じゃう |
| ては・では | ちゃ・じゃ |
| なければ | なきゃ |
| なくては | なくちゃ |


## Sentence Pattern 32
```
(言わないこと）なきゃ（いけまい、ommited during casual conv.）
```
Normally the `言わないこと` would be in the  `て` form, `たら` form or `かも` form if not shortened

The listener can infer what you mean without finishing the sentence
	
### Make some words more casual
Usually `い` and `う` are removed (sometimes even を particles)
* おはよ（う）
* あお（う）
* ありがと（う）
* さよ（う）なら
* でしょ（う）
* いこ（う）

## Sentence Pattern 33
```
Plain/polite っけ (end of sentence)
```
Not clearly understood, heard but forgot; need to confirm

```
んです	->	なんだっけ
```
If its learned about it in the past, even if it hasn't occurred yet, the past tense can be used

## Bonus - Sentence Ending Particles
* `よ`	- when expressing new info, announcement
* `ね`	- same opinion/thought, want confirmation
* `よね`	- speaker and listener both know and confirmed to emphasize

## Sentence Pattern 34
```
plain past (た）	りして(end of sentence)
```
`かもしれない` feeling but implies that there are other possibilities

> Primarily used by young people
{.prompt-info}

## Sentence Pattern 35 - Even if
For Positives
```
(Vた・いAdjくた・なAdjだ・Nだ)		って
```		

For Negatives
```	
(Vなくた・いAdjくなくた・なAdjじゃなくた・Nじゃなくた)	って
```
Basically `ても` (formal, N4 L21[fn^1]) to `たって` (casual)

	
## Sentence Pattern 36 - 
```
Plain	にきまっている
```
Plain clause: must be the case
Say strongly that you are absolutely sure

## Sentence Pattern 37
```
Plain	じゃない
```

## Sentence Pattern 41
