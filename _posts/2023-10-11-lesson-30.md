# Lesson 29　- Transitive verbs 自動詞

## Sentence Pattern 1 - State + Intention/Purpose
```
(Optional; Place　に) (Noun)が　(Transitive Verb. て形) あります
```
Much like Lesson 29, SP2, this SP is also used to express a continuing state. But this SP has the nuance of the action being intentionally done.

> This SP doesn't follow the basic rule of Transitive Verbs being paired with `を`.
{: .prompt-warning}

## Sentence Pattern 2
```
(Noun)は (Place)に　(Transitive Verb. て形) あります
```

## Sentence Pattern 3
```
(Certain time) (Transitive Verb. て形) おきます
```
This indicates the the Transitive verb **must** be completed by a certain time

Usually `(の)前に` is used to express the certain time.

## Sentence Pattern 4
```
(Transitive Verb. て形) おきます
```
Although structurally same as SP3, this SP means **for the next use**

## Sentence Pattern 5 - Request version
This combines SP3 or SP4 and Lesson 14, SP1[^fn1] to turn SP3 into a request
```
～　おいて　ください
```
