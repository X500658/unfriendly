# Lesson 28

## Sentence Pattern 1 -　ながら
```
(Verb 1, ます形)ながら　(Verb 2)
```
Verb 1 here is the circumstance while Verb 2 is the main action.

Note that for things that are done within a short period of time, Verb 2 just ends in ます, but if it is done over a long period of time, ています should be used instead.

## Sentence Pattern 2
```
 (Verb・Adj・Noun; all in 普通形)し・・・(Verb・Adj・Noun; all in 普通形)し・・・(Verb)
```
Used to list similar things of same polarity much like in Lesson 16, SP2[^fn1].

Don't forget that when you have `が` in the clause you're using, you have to change it into `も`

## Sentence Pattern 3 - Multiple reasons
```
(Verb・Adj・Noun; all in 普通形)し・・・(Verb)から
```
This still follows the rule of the previous SP but the final `し` is replaced with `から` (because), to indicate the reasons
