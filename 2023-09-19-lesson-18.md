# Lesson 17 - 形

## Making the 形
The grouping are exactly the same with the て形

### Group 1
Turn the I’s into U’s. There are no special cases.

### Group 2
Simply remove `ます` and replace with `る`

Don't forget about the special cases[^fn1] here.

### Group 3

| ます形 | 形 |
| -- | -- |
| します | る |
| <ruby>来<rt>く</rt>ます<ruby> | <ruby>来<rt>く</rt>る</ruby> |

Note the special with 来る, it also applies with 持って来る

## Sentence Pattern 1 - Ability
```
()
```
Note that by adding `` to the verb's , the verb has become a noun

### Question Form
```
(Interrogative) (Verb, )
```

## Sentence Pattern 2
```
(Verb, )
```

## Sentence Pattern 3
```
(Verb 1, )(Verb 2, )
```
Verb 2 takes place before Verb 1. Compare this to Lesson 16's SP4[^fn2] where Verb 1 must be done first.

When using a quantifier, don't forget that it's interrogative pair is ``

## and 

### 
`` expresses hope (usually with a verb in) or request (with the SP)

### Not easily, not as expected
Don't forget that this is used with verbs in the negative form.
